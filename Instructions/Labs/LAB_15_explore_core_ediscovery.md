# Lab-15: Explore the Core eDiscovery workflow

## Lab scenario
In this lab you will go through the steps required for setting up Core eDiscovery and then go through the Core eDiscovery workflow, by creating an eDiscovery hold, creating a search query, and then exporting the results of the search.  Note:  Licensing for Core eDiscovery requires the appropriate organization subscription and per-user licensing. If you aren’t sure which licenses support core eDiscovery, visit Get started with Core eDiscovery.

#### Task 1:  To access Core eDiscovery or be added as a member of a Core eDiscovery case, a user must be assigned the appropriate permissions. In this task, you as the global admin, will add specific users as members of the eDiscovery Manager role group.
   
1. From the left navigation pane of the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Show all**.

1. In the window that opens, notice how there are two sub-groups, eDiscovery Manager and eDiscovery Administrator.  Read the description of each.  For this lab lab, we will add members to the eDiscovery Administrator sub-group. Select **Edit**, next to eDiscovery Administrator.  As a general best practice, users should be assigned the least privilege required for their role.

1. Close all the tabs except the **admin.microsoft.com** and then sign out from the admin center page and sign-in back again to reflect the permissions added for users faster.

#### Task 2:  In this task you, as an eDiscovery Administrator (ODL admin is an eDiscovery administrator), will create a case to start using Core eDiscovery.

1. Open the Microsoft 365 admin center tab on your browser.

1. From the left navigation panel, under Admin Centers, select **Compliance**.

1. The case should now appear on the list.

    ![](../Images/sc-900-lab15-T2-3.png)

1. As the creator of the case and because you have eDiscovery Administrator privileges, you can begin to work with it.  

1. Keep this browser tab open, as you will use it in the subsequent task.

#### Task 3:  Now that you have created a Core eDiscovery case, you can begin to work with the case.  In this task, you will create an eDiscovery hold for the case for you just created.  Specifically, you will crate a hold for the the exchange mailbox belonging to ODL-User.

1. Open the Core eDiscovery tab on your browser.

1. From the Core eDiscovery page, select the case you created in the previous tab, **SC900 Test Case**. 

1. From the Home page of the case, select the **Hold** tab then select **+Create**.

1. Keep this browser tab open, as you will use it in the subsequent task.

#### Task 4:  With a hold in place, you will create a search query.  Once your search is complete you will go export and download the results for future investigation.   Note:  Searches associated with a Core eDiscovery case are not listed on the Content search page in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. These searches are listed only on the Searches page of the associated Core eDiscovery case.

#### Review

In this lab you went through the steps required to get started with core eDiscovery, including setting up the role permissions for eDiscovery and creating an eDiscovery case.  With the case, created you went through the Core eDiscovery workflow, by creating an eDiscovery hold, creating a search query and then you read on the process of exporting the results of the search to use further investigation.
