# Lab Scenario Preview: Lab-04: Explore identity governance in Azure AD with Privileged Identity management.

## Lab overview

In this lab, you will explore some of the basic functionality of Privileged Identity Management (PIM). PIM does require Azure AD Premium P2. In this lab, you, as the admin, will configure one of your users, Diego Siciliani, with an Azure AD user administrator role, through Privileged ID management (PIM). With user admin privileges, Diego will be able to create users and groups manage licenses and more. Both the admin and the user, Diego, must be configured for the Azure AD Premium P2 license.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:
